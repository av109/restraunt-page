Welcome to the **Restaurant Page** project! This project is a dynamic web application built entirely using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal of this project is to create a single-page restaurant website where the content is dynamically rendered using JavaScript without requiring a page reload. This project also utilizes Webpack to bundle multiple JavaScript files into a single, optimized file for production

**Key Features:**
    **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: All content on the page (e.g., home, menu, contact) is added and updated dynamically using JavaScript.

    **Single-Page Application (SPA):** The page does not reload when navigating between sections (Home, Menu, Contact).

    **Webpack Integration:** Webpack is used to bundle multiple JavaScript files, CSS, and assets into a single production-ready build.

    **Modular Code**: The project is structured using ES6 modules for better organization and maintainability.
